# 3D Rendering with Java

This project is a personal exploration into the world of 3D rendering using Java. It's a departure from my usual work, offering a unique challenge and an opportunity to delve into a different aspect of programming.

The 3D rendering was created based on the insightful guide provided in this [blog post](http://blog.rogach.org/2015/08/how-to-create-your-own-simple-3d-render.html). The blog post offers a step-by-step tutorial on creating a simple 3D renderer, which served as a great starting point for this project.

## Project Overview

The project involves creating a 3D renderer from scratch using Java. The renderer is capable of displaying 3D objects defined by a set of triangles. It uses a basic form of 3D rendering known as z-buffering or depth buffering to handle occlusion.

## Learning Outcomes

This project served as a practical exercise to enhance my Java skills. It provided a hands-on experience with 3D graphics, a field that I had not previously explored. The project also helped in understanding the underlying principles of 3D rendering and computer graphics.

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation serves as a basic 3D renderer, there are several potential improvements and features that could be added in the future, such as implementing different shading models, adding textures, or even incorporating a basic physics engine.

Feel free to explore the code and share your thoughts or suggestions. Contributions are always welcome! ðŸ˜Š
